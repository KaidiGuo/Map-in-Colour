###Help button give a more into detail explain on each layer objects.


Until 22.1.2017
functions have been achieved:
* Display different layers with colour use Leaflet map
* Get user location using a button (Here is the part I do not like about Leaflet map)
* Toolbar + DrawerLayout 

functions considered important in the future:
* Change POI scale level, so even in a big scale view, dots can still be seen.(May be difficult, need to check Leaflet API)
* Add search function.
